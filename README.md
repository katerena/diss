# FAQs

*Q: When will this be completed?*

A: My defense is scheduled for May 19th, 2016, and the last possible date I can submit the final version to the school is June 24th, 2016. 

*Q: Can you notify me when this is done?*

A: For anyone who would like to be added to the email list for getting notified when it's done, please leave a comment [on this issue](https://github.com/katerena/diss/issues/1) or email me (see last question)

*Q: With the understanding that this is not a completed work, where can I access the most up to date version?*

A: [output.pdf](output.pdf)

*Q: Why didn't you cite ___ as background and/or related work?*

A: Because this was an interdisciplinary work whose primary contribution is the empirical study. However, please tell me about oversights and omissions by commenting [on this issue](https://github.com/katerena/diss/issues/2) or emailing (see below). Many thanks!

*Q: Why does this repository not show the full history of writing process?*

A: First, that would have added pressure and anxiety, of which I generate plenty as it is. Second, I was concerned that because this is the first major long piece of writing I have produced, that I would carelessly include some participant's actual name or initials. This would have been Very Bad so I decided to make nothing this public until I did reasonable due diligence to double-check for anonymization. That coincided with my date for distributing the manuscript a month before the defense.

*Q: I have additional questions, comments, suggestions, avenues for future work, ideas for possible collaboration, etc. How can I contact you?*

A: firstname.lastname@gmail.com, using the "Katerena Kuksenok" spelling of my name.
