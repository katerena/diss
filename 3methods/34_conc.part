\section{Summary}

This study is about \textbf{deliberate programming skill acquisition} in a field where a dizzying variety of research methods have burgeoned and co-existed: including inventing data collection hardware, as well as decades of collaborative production of computational model dote and of sharing increasingly-complex global datasets. Whether the changes that the field is undergoing will be seen as radical shifts in science craftsmanship (e.g., as in \cite{jackson2013infrastructure}) or not, the goal of this research is to provide a detailed look at programming work in this moment in time through a cross-section that spans a variety of oceanography research questions and methods.

As background in Chapter 2, I described a divide between modeling and observation, and some ways that software is involved in each. Additionally, I presented some research on software engineering practices in scientific domains. In this chapter, I introduced the methods and the participant population. In Chapter 4, I will introduce the working environment and the perfect world as phenomena, and as they are experienced by the scientists. In Chapter 5, I will expand the discussion to include the narratives, influences, and pressures of software engineering in the \emph{programming-oriented} aspects of what is and what could be. In Chapter 6, I further expand the discussion to the full proposed model of change in scientific code work.
