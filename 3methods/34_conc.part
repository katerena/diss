\section{Summary}

This study is about \textbf{deliberate programming skill acquisition} in a field where a dizzying variety of research methods have burgeoned and co-existed, including inventing data collection hardware, as well as decades of collaborative production on computational models and of sharing increasingly-complex global datasets. In this chapter, I provided a glimpse into some of the challenges and social dynamics I observed in the field setting of this study. In particular, I illustrated way in which oceanographers actively interrogate the validity of the scientific products affected by code work. I also introduced the role of the \textit{software advisor} as a means for the study of social resources informed by computer science and software engineering. A software advisor (SA) may not self-identify as a ``real programmer,'' but he or she is approached as an expert resource by others in the team.

In this chapter, I introduced the methods and the participant population. In Chapter 4, I will introduce the concepts of the working environment and the perfect world, and show how they are experienced by the scientists. In Chapter 5, I will expand the discussion to include the narratives, influences, and pressures of software engineering in the \emph{programming-oriented} aspects of what is and what could be. In Chapter 6, I further expand the discussion to the full proposed model of change in scientific code work.
