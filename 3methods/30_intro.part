\chapter{Observing How Oceanographers Code}

The hypotheses, theories, and frameworks in this dissertation are based on observation of individual scientists grappling with code. Code work constitutes only a part of the overall range of the daily work done by the scientists who participated in the study as informants. As explored in Section 2.3, how big this part is or its position in the overall context of work is coupled to the type ofoceanogrpahy work underway. ``Observing'' code is just about as quiet as it sounds. I sat in a corner taking notes. A scientist (Erin) sat at her workstation. She ran a script in terminal and sat back, watching as image after image comes on-screen. The images in her workflow are most often line plots with multiple lines for making comparisons or rainbow-colored maps of the geographical region of interest. Each new rainbow-map with different bright blue (or red) blobs in different places, indicating different temperature gradients produced by running the model with different parameters, or for longer time spans. The scientist sighed and looked at the screen with a furrowed brow. ``What are you doing now?'' I asked. ``Oh,'' she answered. ``Trying to convince myself that it works.''

I asked her follow up questions either in the moment or during a coffee or lunch break, having made a note of the event but not wanting to disturb her work. I asked her what would make the output ``convincing,'' which ``it'' is in doubt, and what is meant by ``working.'' Her answers identify some code components as \textit{persistent}: reliable and robust over time. Other components are \textit{ephemeral}: with the expectation of imminent degradation, such as if the idiosyncratic data format of a third-party site for which a script is written suddenly changes. Additionally, code can be \textit{brittle}: uncertain in an unclear way; inspiring the expectation of breaking, but without a clear enough idea of how it might break that a preventative measure might be taken. The terms \textit{persistent}, \textit{ephemeral}, \textit{brittle} are not often stated by the participant, but they are reduced to these labels as I iterate through my notes. Some code components are implemented the way they are for ``historical'' reasons: a prior colleague had preferred a particular working environment, and this had specific, tenacious, possibly vestigial ramifications. If the scientist had more time, she would change this or that component, but she does not, so she thinks aloud about what circumstances would create sufficient pressure to make the change. Yet another component used to work, but might not now, because the group has upgraded to an updated version of a core software and it is not yet clear how that has affected this component. In this way, the properties of the code are contextualized in an interpersonal and historical narrative. The goal of the analysis is to identify patterns in these code narratives in different groups, and how they affect deliberate change. In this case, in the process of runningthe model with multiple settings and making sense of the results, Erin shows us how scientifc practice is deeply intertwined with the computing tools they use.

In this chapter, I introduce the methods (observation and interview), the site (oceanography), and the participant population (the particular oceanography teams studied). By the end, the reader will have both a sense of the scientific and social context of code work, as well as a clear idea of concrete study procedures.

%the study sites and participants, and introduce two key concepts that will be used in the following sections: \emph{working environment} and \emph{collective imagination of the perfect world}. These two concepts both aim to \emph{describe} complementary aspect of the mundane, lived reality of code work for the population studied: \emph{what is}, and \emph{what could be}. They are central for the claims in the following chapters, which further elaborate on the temporal aspects of the code work done by the scientists studied.
