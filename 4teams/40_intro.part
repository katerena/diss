\chapter{The Working Environment \& the Perfect World}

In this chapter I develop two components of the proposed model: the \emph{working environment} and the \emph{perfect world}. My narration in this chapter takes on the language of the participants to offer the reader the meanings and values that inform the complex reality of ``what is'' and their collective imagination of ``what could be.''  Visual display of data and results is a central component both of the expression and negotiation of this imagination. Chapter 5 will build upon this chapter to expand the vocabulary to include ``best practices'' as one form of influence from software engineering practice. 

The \textit{working environment} is that collection of tools, skills, contexts, and social arrangements in which a scientist produces code. Consider Erin, a post-doc in the RegionalNowcast-Model team, works with both observational data and models. She has two different working environments, or ``set-ups'' for the tasks, which are distinct enough in her mind that, in this observation session, she accidentally re-implements a small utility that exists in one environment when she is in the other environment. She forgets that she can use this minor technological resource across the environments, and this occurs to her once she explains to me what she had accomplished.
