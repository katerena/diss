\chapter{The Working Environment \& the Perfect World}

In this chapter I developtwo components of the proposed model: the \emph{working environment} and the \emph{perfect world}. My narration in this chapter takes on the language of the participants to offer the reader of the meanings and values that inform the complex reality of ``what is'' and their collective imagination of ``what could be.'' The following chapter expands the vocabulary to include ``best practices'' as one form of influence from software engineering practice.

The \textit{working environment} is that collection of tools, skills, practices, and resources in which a scientist produces code. Erin, a post-doc in the RegionalNowcast-Model team, works both with observational data and models, and she has two different working environments, or ``set-ups'' for the tasks, which are distinct enough in her mind that, at one point, she accidentally re-implements a small utility that exists in one environment when she is in the other environment - she forgets that she can use this minor technological resource across the environments, and this occurs to her once she explains to me what she had accomplished.
