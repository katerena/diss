\section{Summary}

In this chapter, I introduced the concepts of the working environment and the collective imagination of the perfect world. The \textit{working environment} is articulated in terms of its technical components, but also includes mental models and social context. The immediate focus of the working environment is on the visible aspects of code work: what programs are used, who is asked for help, when something is taking ``too long.'' The collective imagination of \textit{the perfect world}, on the other hand, refers to the open-ended, but directional, curiosity that drives events like workshops and skill-shares.

Visual display of data and results is a central component both of \textit{what is} and the \textit{imagination of what could be}. In Section 4.3, I review some social patterns involving visualization and some common elements of the visual vocabulary. The goal of these details is to provide context for the next chapter. In Chapter 5, I focus on that part of the perfect world that emphasizes the adoption of ``best practices'' from software engineering to improve the quality of products of code work. Throughout the section of that chapter, I include stories that justify \textit{adaptation} (rather than direct adoption) of best practices because of some existing dynamic that is rooted in the role that visualizations play in embedding code work in scientific practice.
