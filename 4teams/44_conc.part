\section{Summary}

In this chapter, I introduced the concepts of the working environment and the collective imagination of the perfect world. The \textit{working environment} is articulated in terms of its technical components, but also includes cognitive and social components. In the case of oceanography in particular, the highly specialized visual vocabulary shared within and across sub-field constitutes the cognitive component. The immediate focus of the working environment is on the visible aspects of code work: what programs are used, who is asked for help, when something is taking ``too long.'' The collective imagination of \textit{the perfect world}, on the other hand, refers to the open-ended, but directional, curiosity that drives events like workshops and skill-shares. Listening for phrases like ``the ideal would be...'' or ``in the perfect world...'' can reveal values, motivations, and priorities with respect to all three aspects of the working environment.

Visual display of data and results is a central component both of \textit{what is} and the \textit{imagination of what could be}. In Section 4.3, I review some social patterns involving visualization and some common elements of the visual vocabulary. The goal of these details is to provide context for the next chapter. In Chapter 5, I focus on that part of the perfect world that emphasizes the adoption of ``best practices'' from software engineering to improve the quality of products of code work. Throughout the section of that chapter, I include stories that justify \textit{adaptation} of best practices (rather than direct adoption)  because of some existing dynamic that is rooted in the role that visualizations play in embedding code work in scientific practice.
